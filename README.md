# init.nvim
My neovim config. Mostly just things I use, not everything is used very often.

## installing
```sh
cd ~/.config                                            # going into the config folder
git clone https://github.com/BloemGamer/init.nvim.git   # cloning the directory
mv init.nvim nvim                                       # renaming the directory
```

> [!WARNING]
> the config has some dependencies
> ```sh
> neovim    # obviously
> git       # for lazy
> make      # I think, and most linux users have this already
> npm       # sadly
> # probably something more, but I don't know
> ```
